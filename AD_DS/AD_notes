Domain Controllers

A domain controller is a Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest.
Center of the AD, it could control the rest of the domain
Handles authentication and authorization, holds data storage
Replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest
Allow admin access to manage domain resources

AD DS data store

Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
accessible only by the domain controller

Forest 

without forest all of the other trees and domains would not be able to interact.
A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
Domain Schema - Rules for object creation


Users

Domain Admins - This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.

Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins) - These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account

Local Administrators - These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller

Domain Users - These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization.

Groups

Security Groups - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users

Distribution Groups - These groups are used to specify email distribution lists. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration

Default securtity group

Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
Domain Guests - All domain guests
Domain Users - All domain users
Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
